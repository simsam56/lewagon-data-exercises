# Pandas Practice

## Dataset

Download the [IMDB-Movie-Data.csv](https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/Reboot/IMDB-Movie-Data.csv) and load it into a data frame.

The fastest way to do that is using the terminal `curl` command. Instructions will be in the notebook!

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will be playing around with the basics of Pandas

Along the way, you will use pandas to:

- Investigate the dataframe
- Generate relevant seaborn plots
- Update values in the dataframe
- Find correlations between features
- Engineer new features for your dataframe

## Let's go

To start the exercise, open `pandas_practice.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.

🚀 Your turn!
