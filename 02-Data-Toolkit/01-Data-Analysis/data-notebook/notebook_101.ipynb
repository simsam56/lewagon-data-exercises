    "## What is Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook is a document that contains both code (e.g. Python) and rich text elements (paragraphs, equations, figures, links, etc. thanks to [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/))\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook combines three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **notebook web application**: An interactive web application for writing and running code interactively and authoring notebook documents.\n",
    "2. **Kernels**: Separate processes started by the notebook web application that runs users’ code in a given language and returns the output back to the notebook web application. The kernel also handles things like computations for interactive widgets, tab completion and introspection.\n",
    "3. **Notebook documents**: Self-contained documents that contain a representation of all content visible in the notebook web application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, narrative text, equations, images, and rich media representations of objects. Each notebook document has its own kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "Through Jupyter’s kernel and messaging architecture, the Notebook allows code to be run in a range of different programming languages. For each notebook document that a user opens, the web application starts a kernel that runs the code for that notebook. Each kernel is capable of running code in a single programming language and there are kernels available in the following languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Python](https://github.com/ipython/ipython)\n",
    "- [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)\n",
    "- [R](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel)\n",
    "- [Ruby](https://github.com/sciruby/iruby)\n",
    "\n",
    "The default kernel runs Python code. The notebook provides a simple way for users to pick which of these kernels is used for a given notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these kernels communicate with the notebook web application and web browser using a JSON over ZeroMQ/WebSockets message protocol that is described [here](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/messaging.html). Most users don’t need to know about these details, but it helps to understand that “kernels run code.”\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't remember which Kernels are already installed on your laptop, open your terminal and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter kernelspec list\n",
    "```\n",
